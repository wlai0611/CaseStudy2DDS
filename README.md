# CaseStudy2DDS
CaseStudy2-data.csv contains data about employees such as Age, Gender, how long they have worked in the company, whether or not they
left (attrition), and their salary.

casestudy.rmd builds two predictive models: one to predict a worker's salary and another to predict whether a worker attritioned.  
The RMD includes a link to a presentation.
